MATH 340 201 Term Project Proposal \
Janice Chan and Tina Jia

Budgeting and calorie intake are very important factors for university students when making decisions on where to eat, as university tuition is costly, and calories are necessary to energize oneself in order to learn and study. Here at UBC, there is a residence meal plan, which is mainly used by first-year students living on campus. However, it can be restricted for students who find it too expensive or want to customize what restaurants they eat at. Therefore, we aim to create our own meal plan to optimize the calorie intake per dollar each day throughout the school year, with three meals from three different restaurants around UBC. This will not only meet the calorie intake requirements for students but also be more cost-efficient than the UBC residence meal plan with price and restaurant exposure taken into account. 

In order to get the most calories while maintaining the budget, we want to maximize the calorie intake per dollar of meals daily. It is beneficial to have three meals: breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day. Since eating three meals from the same restaurant may not be tasteful over time, in our linear programming problem, no meals per day will come from the same restaurant. Furthermore, studies show that having a larger lunch and smaller breakfast, followed by dinner is optimal for dividing calorie intake and sleep quality, so the meal plan in our linear programming problem would reflect the same to optimize the diet*. It is important to meet calorie intake as well as not to exceed it, so ensuring the meal plan does not exceed or fail to meet the daily calorie intake listed for the maximum or minimum intake of male and female students combined will provide the best general meal plan for UBC students. This also includes not being able to consume less than 0 calories. According to eat right, adult womens’ daily calorie needs range from 1,600 to 2,200, while for adult men, it ranges from 2,000 to 3,200 per day**. Therefore, we will set the general range of our diet plan to be within 1,600 to 3,200 calories per day.

To compare against the residence meal plan, our meal plan will include restaurants that are within walking distance around the UBC Vancouver campus, without being restricted to the residence meal plan restaurants. Our meal plan will also result in a daily cost that does not exceed the daily cost of the residence meal plan over the period of a full school year. According to food.ubc.ca as of February 02, 2022, the total for a Residence Meal Plan across both school terms amounts to $5,579.72***. Since the 2022 winter school term spans from September 7, 2021, to April 8, 2022, we will calculate the daily cost to be the cost of the meal plan spent over 213 days****. In order to plan the restaurants’ calorie intake, it is difficult to account for the varying calories and prices of different meals each restaurant offers. Thus, we will find the average calorie intake and the average price of a meal from each restaurant from the entire (current) menu to represent the calorie intake and price of a meal for each restaurant. There are also various types of restaurants on campus, to which we restricted restaurants to be of the following (inside UBC campus and along University Blvd to be of walking distance to classes or on-campus):
* Tim Hortons
* Starbucks
* Uncle Fatih’s pizza
* A&W Canada 
* Perugia Italian Caffe
* McDonalds
* Gather
* Triple O’s


Although we are restricting certain restaurants, just like the UBC residence meal plan, it still provides more flexibility with various included and excluded restaurants from the UBC residence meal plan. We did not include restaurants inside the Nest, food court stalls, and student or club-run restaurants due to varying prices and lack of information, as inconsistencies that would not be helpful for budgeting and thus excluded from our curated meal plan. An inconsistency we are ignoring menu items that are on the breakfast/brunch, soups/sides, and dessert/baked goods menu and restaurant hours, as student schedules and meal times are beyond our scope. We are also not including adjustments to menu items such as adding, removing, or substituting ingredients. Additionally, we are excluding beverages, sides, and restaurants’ kid’s menus, as we are creating a university students’ diet for meals. A note to consider is that some restaurants have changing menus and some do not list calories or prices. We will find information to the best of our abilities with the currently available menu or what we can find online, including reaching out to ask franchisees for calories. We will also utilize resources, such as UBC Nutrislice***** , which provides information for some UBC restaurants. Some restaurant pricing is also not fixed, for example, the UBC residence halls (Feast and Gather) have some prices where the amount of food you personally add to your plate determines the price. Instead, we will calculate the average meal costs for those restaurants by calculating the average of fixed-price meals.

Finding a solution to our problem will answer the optimal three meals to have at UBC to fulfill calorie intake, and to have meal costs over the school year to be less than that of the UBC residence meal plan. The resulting solution will benefit student meals and budgeting in order to fulfill the best diet (in terms of calories) and prices. Finding no solution suggests that the UBC residence meal plan is a better deal for calorie intake per cost and that students should utilize it!
